# RankEm Team Database
Here, you'll find a list of every single FBS + FCS football team and all of their logos as well.
This was done by compiling a list of all the teams using Wikipedia and then using the ESPN API to find the best matching team name from ESPN's site listing to Wikipedia.
It then downloads all of the team logos. There were some teams I had to adjust manually that didn't pull the correct team logo.
